# Unit Testing with ViTest
This project was build to learn about ViTest and TDD. 


### Setup
- First clone the repository to your machine
- Run `npm install`
- After installing, run `npm test` in one of the directories to run the tests.

### Important Package Scripts
```json
 "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest --run --reporter verbose",
    "test:watch": "vitest",
    "start": "http-server -c-1"
  },
```

### What I learned
This project taught me the basics of test driven development. I now understand what a unit is, how to create unit tests, and how to create Integration tests.
